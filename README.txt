GetFinancing (http://www.getfinancing.com/ ) module allows your DrupalCommerce
shop to offer monthly payments to your consumers.

General Instructions
-----------------------------
1. Create your merchant account to offer monthly payment options to your consumers directly on your ecommerce from here (http://www.getfinancing.com/signup) if you haven't done it yet.
2. Download our module from the latest release here (https://github.com/GetFinancing/getfinancing-drupalcommerce/releases) or all the code in a zip file from here (https://github.com/GetFinancing/getfinancing-drupalcommerce/archive/master.zip)
3. Setup the module with the information found under the Integration section on your portal account https://partner.getfinancing.com/partner/portal/. Also remember to change the postback url on your account for both testing and production environments. 
4. Once the module is working properly and the lightbox opens on the request, we suggest you to add some conversion tools to your store so your users know before the payment page that they can pay monthly for the purchases at your site. You can find these copy&paste tools under your account inside the Integration section.
